QuickPick v1.0  alpha

Disclaimer:
QuickPick is in an early development phase. Expect Bugs all the time and everywhere. Usage is at your own risk. 
The developer behind QuickPick can not be held responsible for dataloss, hardwarmalfunction, mental-breakdown, WWIII or any other inconveniance.

When QuickPick is launched, a QP-Icon will be shown in task-bar. Upon right click, the settings option will be displayed. 


At this point QuickPicks funtionality consists of two things:

- Show the shortcuts that are in a user-selected folder
- Show 8 buttons which functionality can be tweaked by the user.

For the 8 buttons there are a few options:
- None:					Does nothing.
- Run Process:			This will simple launch an application using the associated file selected.
- Run Query:			Copies the text from the associated file onto a new File (uses ctrl+N command).
						This was initially used within SSMS along with a Run-command, hence the name 'run query'.
- Take screen Snippet:	This will let the user take a screen snippet using Windows 10 built-in snippet application.
- Exit QuickPick: Shuts down the QuickPick application.

Functionality that will be added in the future:

- Option to show active application windows 
- Create a list of shortcuts rather then selecting an entire folder.
- Expand functionality of the main 8 buttons.
- Option to send a bugreport and feedback to the developer.
- Any thing else that might be useful.
