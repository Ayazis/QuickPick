# QuickPick
## Overview
QuickPick is a hobby project of mine. When working on multiple 4K monitors, I always feel the windows taskbar is always to far away.
QuickPick brings the taskbar right there where you are, at your mouse-cursor. 


## Features
- Active Application Management: QuickPick keeps track of your active applications, allowing you to switch between them seamlessly.
- More features will come.

## KeyLogger statement:
QuickPick uses a keyboard hook to intercept and manage keyboard input. This is only used to determine the HotKey combination.
